## Hi! I'm Stacy Jean-Philippe 👋

[![Email Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gmail-D14836?style=for-the-badge&logo=gmail&logoColor=white)](mailto:stacyjeanphilippe1212@gmail.com)  [![LinkedIn Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-0077B5?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stacy-jean-philippe/)

I'm a Data Analyst & Instructional Consultant by trade.

My skills include Advanced Excel, SQL, Business Analytics, and Data Visualization/Storytelling. My aim these days is to use my quantitative skills to drive organizational success in the EdTech/Corporate Training sphere.  

Currently, I generate data-driven insights to improve the instructional outcomes of the university faculty I work with. Specifically, my work centers on analyzing post-session reports written by consultants and feedback survey data from faculty to assess training needs, measure the effectiveness of our training programs, and identify opportunities to optimize our asynchronous resources. 

My previous role as a Senior Academic Analysis Specialist involved a great deal of direct interaction with stakeholders which gave me the chance to hone the communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills I use regularly in my work today. 

I'm excited at the prospect of you getting to know my work better. Please take your time perusing my GitHub and checking out my projects!


There's more to me than just work though! Here are some fun facts about me: 

- 👘 I’m currently learning Japanese as a hobby (I've visited there twice!)
- 📺 I am a huge k-drama lover (particularly obsessed with thrillers/mysteries). 
- 🍪 My sweet tooth is unrivaled - I would have dessert after every meal if I could.
- 🎯 My goal for this year is to land my dream data job working on a team with like-minded "Number Nerds"!
